# CSM152A - Introductory Digital Design Laboratory, Spring 2017

## Course Description
Hands-on design, implementation, and debugging of digital logic circuits, use of computer-aided design tools for schematic capture and simulation, implementation of complex circuits using programmed array logic, design projects. 

### Tools Used
* Hardware: Xilinx Nexys3 Spartan-6 FPGA
* Programming Language: Verilog

### Assignment Overviews
* Lab 1 - Introduction to Verilog and Xilinx ISE
  * Through examples of basic combinational and sequential circuits, you will get to know about Verilog HDL and the Xilinx ISE development environment. You will also get a flavor of the FPGA design workflow.
* Lab 2 - Floating Point Conversion
  * Learned how to use the Xilinx ISE program to design and test a floating point converter
* Lab 3 - Sequencer
  * Studied a sequencer as an example project and do exercises based on the project. 
* Lab 4 - Stopwatch
  * Designed a stopwatch on the FPGA
* Project - Space Invaders
  * My group decided to recreate the classic arcade game Space Invaders for the final project. It is a simplified version
